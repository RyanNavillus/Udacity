My certificate of completion is available [here](https://confirm.udacity.com/FRADHULF).

# Course organization
The class is organized into a number of sections. Each section contains a number of mini-projects, which provided practical experience with the course material. Each section ended with a larger project which was evaluated by one of Udacity's instructors. Each project needed to meet specific criteria to be accepted.
