# Udacity
A collection of my Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Projects

The syllabus for the class is available [here](https://github.com/RyanNavillus/Udacity/blob/master/syllabus.pdf). 
My certificate of completion is available [here](https://confirm.udacity.com/FRADHULF).

# Course organization
The class is organized into a number of sections. Each section contains a number of mini-projects, which provided practical experience with the course material. Each section ended with a larger project which was evaluated by one of Udacity's instructors. Each project needed to meet specific criteria to be accepted.

# Projects
The 5 section projects are listed and described below:
